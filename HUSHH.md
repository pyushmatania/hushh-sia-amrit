### 🛡️ Resilience & Error Handling

#### Error Boundaries
Every route is wrapped in a `<ErrorBoundary>` component that catches React render crashes and shows a recovery UI with "Try Again" button. A global ErrorBoundary wraps the entire router as a last-resort fallback.

| Boundary Level | Scope | Fallback Title |
|---|---|---|
| Global | Entire app (wraps `<BrowserRouter>`) | "App crashed unexpectedly" |
| Home Route | Index page and all sub-screens | "Failed to load home" |
| Admin Route | Admin panel | "Admin panel error" |
| Staff Route | Staff dashboard | "Staff panel error" |

#### Offline Detection
- `useOnlineStatus()` hook tracks `navigator.onLine` + `online`/`offline` window events
- `<OfflineBanner>` renders a fixed top bar with animated entrance/exit when offline
- App remains functional for cached data; new mutations will fail gracefully with toast errors

#### Query Retry Strategy (React Query)
- **Queries**: Retry 2× with exponential backoff (1s → 2s → 4s, max 10s)
- **Mutations**: Retry 1× on failure
- **Stale time**: 30 seconds (prevents unnecessary refetches)
- **Window refocus**: Disabled (prevents data thrashing on tab switch)

#### Rate Limiting Awareness
| Surface | Mechanism | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Auth attempts | Supabase GoTrue built-in | 30/hour per IP |
| Spin Wheel | DB trigger: 1 spin per user per day | 1/day/user |
| Edge Functions | Supabase default rate limit | 100 req/s |
| Search queries | Client-side debounce (300ms) | N/A |
| Order submissions | Optimistic lock via status check | 1 active order/booking |

#### Video & Asset Strategy
- Homepage video cards use `.mp4.asset.json` references resolved at build time
- Videos are lazy-loaded via `IntersectionObserver` (preloadVideos utility)
- Images served through Supabase Storage public buckets (CDN-backed)
- Listing images: `listing-images` bucket | Review photos: `review-images` bucket
- Font loading: `<link rel="preconnect">` + `display=swap` for non-blocking render

### Database Functions
| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `award_loyalty_points(user_id, points, title, icon?)` | Add points + transaction |
| `redeem_loyalty_points(user_id, points, title, icon?)` | Deduct points if sufficient |
| `create_notification(user_id, title, body, type, icon?)` | Insert notification |
| `has_role(user_id, role)` | Check if user has a specific role (security definer) |

### Enums
| Enum | Values |
|------|--------|
| `app_role` | `super_admin`, `ops_manager`, `host`, `staff` |

### Clarifications (from v1.22 Audit)
- **`host_listings` vs "Properties"**: The table is named `host_listings` but is referred to as "Properties" throughout the UI and admin panel
- **`curations` vs `experience_packages`**: Curations are homepage discovery packs (e.g., "Date Night Deluxe"). Experience packages are add-on bundles within the Experience Builder during booking
- **`has_role()` default**: Returns FALSE when no entry exists — new users without roles are treated as regular authenticated users
- **"Work" category**: A cross-pillar filter/tag, not a standalone pillar. "Home" is the default unfiltered view
- **Spin Wheel guest mode**: Uses localStorage for mock spins. Authenticated spins are DB-enforced (1/day)
- **Booking Requests**: Accessible as a tab within the Bookings admin page, not a separate page
- **Finance Hub**: Revenue + Expenses + Budgets consolidated under Earnings in the admin sidebar

---

## 🔒 Security & RLS

All tables have Row-Level Security enabled:
- Users can only read/write their own data
- Conversations: participant match required
- Reviews: anyone can read, only author can write
- Host listings: owner can CRUD, anyone can read active listings
- **Admin access**: `has_role()` security definer function prevents recursive RLS
- **User roles**: Stored in dedicated `user_roles` table (never on profiles)
- Admin-only tables (audit_logs, user_roles management): require `super_admin` role
- Development overrides: Some tables have `public` SELECT policies for dev convenience (marked with "dev" suffix)

## 📋 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Product Overview

**Product Name**: Hushh
**Tagline**: "Your Private Getaway"
**Version**: 1.23
**Platform**: Mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA)
**Market**: Jeypore, Odisha, India (expanding to tier-2/3 cities)

### 2. Problem Statement

In tier-2/3 cities, there's no unified platform for discovering and booking private experiences. Customers rely on word-of-mouth, WhatsApp groups, and fragmented phone calls to find venues for celebrations, getaways, or workspace. Property owners lack tools to manage bookings, pricing, and guest communication professionally.

### 3. Solution

A marketplace connecting experience seekers with private venue owners, offering:
- **One-tap discovery** of curated stays, experiences, and services
- **Bundled experience packs** (curations) that eliminate decision fatigue
- **Real-time operations** for hosts (inventory, orders, staff management)
- **Gamified loyalty** to drive repeat bookings

### 4. Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Monthly Active Users (MAU) | 5,000+ | Auth sessions |
| Booking Conversion Rate | 8-12% | Bookings / Detail Views |

| Repeat Booking Rate | 40%+ | Users with 2+ bookings |
| Host Onboarding | 50+ properties | Active listings |
| NPS Score | 60+ | Quarterly survey |
| App Rating | 4.5+ | Store reviews |

## 📱 Mobile & Responsive Blueprint

> This section documents every mobile-specific decision so an AI can use it as a reference to build the web/desktop version.

### Distribution Strategy

| Channel | Technology | Details |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **PWA** | VitePWA + Workbox | autoUpdate, standalone, portrait, installable from browser |
| **Android APK** | Capacitor 8 | WebView loads live URL (`lovableproject.com`), instant updates without rebuild |
| **CI/CD** | GitHub Actions | Auto-build debug APK on push to main, Java 21, Gradle 8.14 |

### Viewport & Layout

| Rule | Value | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| Design target | 390×844px (iPhone 14/15) | Tested on 360px (Android) and 428px (Pro Max) |
| `overflow-x: hidden` | `html, body, #root` | Prevent horizontal drift from 3D card transforms |
| `overscroll-behavior-x: none` | `html, body, #root` | Disable rubber-band horizontal scroll |
| Layout | Single column stack | All primary screens, 2-col grids for property cards |
| Modals | Bottom sheets (Vaul) | Natural thumb reach zone instead of centered dialogs |
| Sticky elements | Bottom nav, category bar, booking CTA | Fixed/sticky positioning for key interactive elements |

### Responsive Layout Patterns

| Pattern | Screens | Details |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Single Column Stack | Home, Profile, Trips, Messages | Vertical scroll, no side-by-side panels |
| 2-Column Grid | Property cards, Stats, Wishlist | `grid-cols-2` at mobile width |
| Horizontal Carousels | Spotlight, Foodie, Sports, Achievements | `embla-carousel` or CSS `overflow-x-auto` with snap |
| Full-Screen Overlays | Search, Map, Documentation | Back navigation, no partial modals |
| Bottom Sheet Modals | Settings, Edit Profile, Split Pay | Vaul drawer, swipe-to-dismiss |

### Touch & Interaction

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|---------------|
| Touch targets | 44px minimum, bottom nav icons 48px zones |
| Haptic feedback | `navigator.vibrate` on booking confirm, spin wheel, toggles |
| Animations | Framer Motion springs (stiffness: 300, damping: 30), `whileTap={{ scale: 0.95 }}` |
| Swipe gestures | Message conversations, pull-to-refresh (Home), gallery carousel |
| Scroll snap | `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory` on horizontal carousels |

### Mobile Typography Scale

| Element | Size | Weight | Font |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| Page titles | `text-2xl` (24px) | 900 (black) | Space Grotesk |
| Section headers | `text-base` (16px) | 900 (black) | Space Grotesk |
| Card titles | `text-sm` (14px) | 700 (bold) | Space Grotesk |
| Body text | `text-[13px]` | 500 (medium) | Space Grotesk |
| Labels & badges | `text-[11px]` | 700 (bold) | DM Sans |
| Micro text | `text-[9px]`–`text-[10px]` | 500 (medium) | DM Sans |
| Editorial overlays | `text-lg`–`text-2xl` | 700 (bold) | Playfair Display |

**Spacing:** Cards use `p-3` to `p-4` (12–16px). Section gaps: `space-y-4` to `space-y-6`. Screen horizontal padding: `px-4` (16px).

### Aspect Ratios & Media

| Element | Aspect Ratio | Details |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Property card images | 16:10 (`aspect-[16/10]`) | `rounded-2xl`, `object-cover`, lazy loading |
| Spotlight video cards | 16:9 | Autoplay, muted, loop, `playsInline`, poster fallback |
| Gallery carousel | 4:3 | Full-width swipe, dot indicators |
| Avatar images | 1:1 (`rounded-full`) | w-10 to w-20 depending on context |
| Curated pack bg video | Full-screen | Absolute positioned, `object-cover`, z-0 |
| Map view | Full-viewport | Leaflet takes remaining height after header |
| Spin wheel | 1:1 (300×300) | Canvas-rendered, centered |

### Dual Theme System

All colors defined as HSL in `index.css` under `:root` (dark) and `.light`. Components use **semantic tokens only** — never hardcoded colors.

| Token | Dark Mode | Light Mode |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| `--background` | 260 20% 6% | 260 20% 98% |
| `--foreground` | 0 0% 96% | 260 25% 12% |
| `--primary` | 270 80% 65% | 270 72% 52% |
| `--card` | 260 18% 10% | 0 0% 100% |
| `--muted` | 260 12% 16% | 260 14% 94% |
| `--border` | 260 15% 16% | 260 16% 90% |

Theme-aware utilities: `glass`/`glass-light`, `glow-sm/md/lg`, `shadow-card/elevated`, `text-gradient`. All transition in 0.4s.

### Mobile Performance Optimizations

| Optimization | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Service Worker | Workbox: NetworkFirst for API, CacheFirst for static. 10MB max cache per file |
| Font Loading | 4 Google Fonts via `rel="preload" as="style"` + `onload` pattern. Non-render-blocking |
| LazySection | Home sections wrapped in `IntersectionObserver` — render only when in viewport |
| OptimizedImage | Native lazy loading, blur-up placeholder, error fallback. `object-cover` |
| Video Preloading | `lib/video-preloader.ts` preloads spotlight videos. `playsInline + muted + loop` for autoplay |
| React Query Cache | 30s staleTime, 2× retry with exponential backoff |
| Critical Preconnects | `fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`, `supabase.co` |
| Inline Splash | HTML-inline splash (no JS) for instant FCP, replaced by React `SplashScreen` |

### Navigation Architecture

**Bottom Navigation (5 tabs):**

| Tab | Icon | Screen |
|-----|------|--------|
| Explore | 🏠 Home | HomeScreen — feed, search, categories |
| Wishlists | ❤️ Heart | WishlistScreen — saved properties grid |
| Trips | ✈️ Plane | TripsScreen — active/upcoming/past/cancelled |
| Messages | 💬 Chat | MessagesScreen — conversations + chat |
| Profile | 👤 User | ProfileScreen — settings, loyalty, host |

**Patterns:** State machine navigation (not React Router for internal screens), back button via `onBack` prop, sheet/drawer for settings, full-screen for search/map, tab memory preserved.

### Capacitor Configuration

| Config | Value |
|--------|-------|
| appId | `com.hushh.jeypore` |
| appName | `Hushh Jeypore` |
| webDir | `dist` |
| server.url | `https://hushh-jeypore.lovable.app` (live — instant updates) |
| Build pipeline | GitHub Actions → npm install → build → cap add android → cap sync → gradlew assembleDebug → APK artifact |

### Native Plugins (v1.34)

| Plugin | Purpose | Bridge File |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `@capacitor/share` | Native share sheet for properties & referrals | `src/lib/native-share.ts` |
| `@capacitor/clipboard` | Copy referral codes, booking IDs | `src/lib/native-share.ts` |
| `@capacitor/network` | Detect WiFi/cellular/offline with real-time listener | `src/lib/native-network.ts` |
| `@capacitor/browser` | In-app browser for external links | `src/lib/native-browser.ts` |
| `@capacitor/preferences` | Persistent key-value storage (replaces localStorage) | `src/lib/native-preferences.ts` |
| `@capacitor/screen-orientation` | Portrait lock on native | `src/lib/native.ts` |
| `@capacitor/keyboard` | iOS keyboard resize mode | `src/lib/native.ts` |
| `@capacitor/app` | Android back button, deep links, app state | `src/lib/native.ts` |
| `@capacitor/push-notifications` | Native push registration & token storage | `src/lib/native.ts` |
| `@capacitor/haptics` | Impact/notification feedback | `src/lib/haptics.ts` |
| `@capacitor/status-bar` | Dark style, #050505 background | `src/lib/native.ts` |
| `@capacitor/camera` | Photo capture (available for reviews, profile) | Direct import |
| `@capacitor/geolocation` | GPS location for nearby properties | Direct import |
| `@capacitor/splash-screen` | Native splash with #050505 background | Capacitor config |
| `@capacitor/local-notifications` | Scheduled local alerts | Direct import |

### Fallback Chain Pattern

All native bridges follow a consistent fallback pattern:
```
Capacitor Native Plugin → Web API → Graceful no-op
```
Example: Share → `@capacitor/share` → `navigator.share()` → `clipboard.writeText()` → silent fail

### PWA Configuration

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| name | Hushh Jeypore |
| display | standalone |
| orientation | portrait |
| theme_color | #050505 |
| registerType | autoUpdate |
| icons | 192×192 + 512×512 (any maskable) |
| navigateFallbackDenylist | /sw-push.js |

### 🤖 AI Prompts for Web/Desktop Conversion

Use these prompts when converting the mobile-first app to a responsive web/desktop version:

1. **Layout Expansion**: Convert single-column mobile layout to multi-panel desktop: sidebar navigation (replace bottom nav), main content area, and optional right panel for details/chat. Use Tailwind `lg:` breakpoints.
2. **Navigation Upgrade**: Replace BottomNav with a persistent left sidebar (collapsible) for desktop. Add breadcrumbs. Convert full-screen overlays (search, map) to panels within the main layout.
3. **Grid Scaling**: Scale property card grids from 2-col (mobile) to 3-col (tablet) to 4-col (desktop). Increase card size proportionally. Add hover states (scale, shadow) that replace tap states.
4. **Bottom Sheets → Modals**: Convert all Vaul bottom sheet dialogs to centered Dialog modals for desktop. Keep bottom sheet behavior for mobile using `useMobile()` hook conditional.
5. **Table Views**: Admin panel: convert card-based mobile lists to full data tables with sorting, filtering, and pagination for desktop viewport. Use shadcn Table component.
6. **Split View**: Messages: implement split-pane layout — conversation list on left (300px), chat thread on right. Property Detail: sticky image gallery on left, info/booking on right.
7. **Responsive Typography**: Scale up: page titles to `text-3xl`, section headers to `text-xl`, body to `text-sm`. Increase spacing: `px-8` on desktop, `max-w-7xl` container.
8. **Mouse Interactions**: Add `hover:scale-105`, `hover:shadow-lg` on property cards. Replace `whileTap` with `whileHover`. Add keyboard shortcuts (Esc to close, Enter to confirm).

## 📐 Conventions & Guidelines

### Adding Features
1. Implement the feature
2. Add changelog entry to `HUSHH.md` under the appropriate version
3. Add entry to `src/components/AppDocumentation.tsx` `changeLog` array
4. Document new screens in Screen-by-Screen section

### Code Style
- Semantic design tokens only — never raw colors
- All colors in HSL
- Framer Motion for animations
- Refactor components >400 lines
- Mock fallbacks in hooks for guest mode

### File Naming
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` | Hooks: `use-kebab.tsx` | Data: `kebab.ts` | Lib: `kebab.ts`

### Admin Development
- All admin components in `src/components/admin/`
- Admin page type must be added to `AdminPage` union in `AdminLayout.tsx`
- New pages must be added to: `AdminLayout` nav items, `CommandPalette` commands, `Admin.tsx` switch/case
- Always use `useAdmin()` hook for role checks — never client-side storage
