## 🔒 Security & RLS

All tables have Row-Level Security enabled:
- Users can only read/write their own data
- Conversations: participant match required
- Reviews: anyone can read, only author can write
- Host listings: owner can CRUD, anyone can read active listings
- **Admin access**: `has_role()` security definer function prevents recursive RLS
- **User roles**: Stored in dedicated `user_roles` table (never on profiles)
- Admin-only tables (audit_logs, user_roles management): require `super_admin` role
- Development overrides: Some tables have `public` SELECT policies for dev convenience (marked with "dev" suffix)

## 📋 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Product Overview

**Product Name**: Hushh
**Tagline**: "Your Private Getaway"
**Version**: 1.20
**Platform**: Mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA)
**Market**: Jeypore, Odisha, India (expanding to tier-2/3 cities)

### 2. Problem Statement

In tier-2/3 cities, there's no unified platform for discovering and booking private experiences. Customers rely on word-of-mouth, WhatsApp groups, and fragmented phone calls to find venues for celebrations, getaways, or workspace. Property owners lack tools to manage bookings, pricing, and guest communication professionally.

### 3. Solution

A marketplace connecting experience seekers with private venue owners, offering:
- **One-tap discovery** of curated stays, experiences, and services
- **Bundled experience packs** (curations) that eliminate decision fatigue
- **Real-time operations** for hosts (inventory, orders, staff management)
- **Gamified loyalty** to drive repeat bookings

### 4. Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Monthly Active Users (MAU) | 5,000+ | Auth sessions |
| Booking Conversion Rate | 8-12% | Bookings / Detail Views |
| Average Order Value (AOV) | ₹3,500+ | Revenue / Bookings |
| Repeat Booking Rate | 40%+ | Users with 2+ bookings |
| Host Onboarding | 50+ properties | Active listings |
| NPS Score | 60+ | Quarterly survey |
| App Rating | 4.5+ | Store reviews |

## 📐 Conventions & Guidelines

### Adding Features
1. Implement the feature
2. Add changelog entry to `HUSHH.md` under the appropriate version
3. Add entry to `src/components/AppDocumentation.tsx` `changeLog` array
4. Document new screens in Screen-by-Screen section

### Code Style
- Semantic design tokens only — never raw colors
- All colors in HSL
- Framer Motion for animations
- Refactor components >400 lines
- Mock fallbacks in hooks for guest mode

### File Naming
- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` | Hooks: `use-kebab.tsx` | Data: `kebab.ts` | Lib: `kebab.ts`

### Admin Development
- All admin components in `src/components/admin/`
- Admin page type must be added to `AdminPage` union in `AdminLayout.tsx`
- New pages must be added to: `AdminLayout` nav items, `CommandPalette` commands, `Admin.tsx` switch/case
- Always use `useAdmin()` hook for role checks — never client-side storage
